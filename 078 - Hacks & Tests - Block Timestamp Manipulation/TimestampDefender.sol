    🕒 The Temptation of Manipulation 🕒
    By altering the block timestamp, you could potentially disrupt the contract's functionality and reap illicit benefits

    📜 The Vulnerabilities and Consequences 📜
    1. Predictable Randomness Attacks
    2. Delay Exploitation
    3. Mining Manipulation
    4. Oracle Exploits

    🛡️ Defenses Against Timestamp Tampering 
    1. Block Hashes
    2. External Oracles
    3. Relative Time

    🛡️ Preventative Techniques:
    1. Avoid Using `block.timestamp` for Randomness
    2. Incorporate Randomness Solutions
