   -> is a type of malicious smart contract that aims to deceive and trap unsuspecting users.
   -> promising high returns or exclusive features. 
   -> however, once you interact with it, the contract exploits vulnerabilities in your transaction to drain your funds.

    💀 How the Honeypot Works:
    1. Promise of High Returns
    2. Complex Control Flow
    3. Hidden Exploit
    4. Fund Draining
    5. Quick Exit

    🛡️ Protection Against Honeypots:
    1. Code Audit
    2. Minimal Trust
    3. Reputable Sources
    4. Community Feedback
    5. Transaction Reversal

// However, the contract secretly switches its behavior after the first investment, ensuring that subsequent investors will lose their funds.
